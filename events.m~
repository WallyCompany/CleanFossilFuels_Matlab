function [value,isterminal,direction] = events(t,y)
%UNTITLED Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here

% value(i) is the value of the function.
% isterminal(i) = 1, if the integration is to terminate at a zero of this event function and 0 otherwise.
% direction(i) = 0 if all zeros are to be computed (the default), +1 if only the zeros where the event function increases, and -1 if only the zeros where the event function decreases.

global dash

value(1) = y(1);     % detect diamater difference = 0
isterminal(1) = 1;   % stop the integration
direction(1) = 0;   % either direction

value(2) = y(2)-dash;     % detect diamater difference = 0
isterminal(2) = 1;   % stop the integration
direction(2) = 0;   % negative direction

end
